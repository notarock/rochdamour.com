      <h4>Hello ðŸ‘‹</h4>
      <p>
        I'm Roch D'Amour, aka
        <a href="https://github.com/notarock">notarock</a>. A Software Developer
        from Quebec, Canada.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm passionate about open-source software and enjoy exploring new tools
        and ideas, whether it's for work or personal side projects. This website
        is where I share my experiences with software development, DevOps, and
        system engineering. I also use this space to share the fun projects I
        work on in my free time or discoveries I make while trying to host and
        maintain services alive for myself, friends and family.
      </p>
      <p>Hopefully, this summary doesn't sound <i>too cliche.</i></p>

    For now, the website is still under construction. I have a backlog of
    content that I still need to get to! Feel free to check in from time to
    time.
